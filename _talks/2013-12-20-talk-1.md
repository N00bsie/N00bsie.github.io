International Open Government Data Search aims to discover, document and analyze data catalogs that are published by different governments 
all over the world. We at Tetherless World Constellation are investigating these open government datasets using semantic web technologies. 
The datasets are published in a variety of data formats for eg.. csv,excel .. These are translated to Resource Description Framework by a 
variety of in-house toolkits that get them onto the Linked Data cloud. As of now we have accumulated 192 catalogs from 43 countries in 
about 24 different languages. This list is exponentially growing as governments of the world are increasingly publishing data for 
public consumption
