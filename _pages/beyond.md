Outside of RPI I enjoy reading books ranging from fiction to non-fiction. Edgar Allan Poe, Roald Dahl, Salman Rushdie, Umberto Eco would always find a place in my list of favourite writers. I enjoy graphic novels as well and rate Alan Moore, Mark Millar, Frank Miller very highly (as if they needed my rating). Anime and manga also find a place in my heart and Hayao Miyazaki, Shinichiro Watanabe and Satoshi Kon are my favourites. In my previous workplace I had time for manga drawing and digital posters using Photoshop, GIMP and Flash but In the last few years I have started to learn Indian Classical music during my free time. I enjoy Western Classical, Indian Classical, Blues, Beatles, Classic Rock, Simon and Garfunkel and a lot of Indian artists. I also play the tin whistle and the harmonica. If you ever wanted to work on language processing and Linked Data or taste Indian cuisine or just Madras Filter Coffee, you can shoot me an email
