Outside of RPI I enjoy reading books ranging from fiction to non-fiction. Edgar Allan Poe, Roald Dahl, Salman Rushdie, Umberto Eco would always find a place in my list of favourite writers. I enjoy graphic novels as well and rate Alan Moore, Mark Millar, Frank Miller very highly (as if they needed my rating). Anime and manga also find a place in my heart and Hayao Miyazaki, Shinichiro Watanabe and Satoshi Kon are my favourites. In my previous workplace I had time for manga drawing and digital posters using Photoshop, GIMP and Flash but In the last few years I have started to learn Indian Classical music during my free time. I enjoy Western Classical, Indian Classical, Blues, Beatles, Classic Rock, Simon and Garfunkel and a lot of Indian artists. I also play the tin whistle and the harmonica.
