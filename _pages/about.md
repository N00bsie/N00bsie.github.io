Hi! I am Amar, a PhD student at the [Tetherless World Constellation](https://tw.rpi.edu/) under the inimitable [Jim Hendler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hendler). I came to RPI in Fall '11 and since then I have stumbled on things like inferring knowledge from text using Knowledge Graphs, Question Answering on Linked Data using Watson, and Summarization of Customer Support Logs.  Before that I used to be a research professional at Infosys Labs and  worked on Sentiment Analysis and Information Extraction. 

Since the Fall of 2015, my research focus has been on introducting the notion of  _Pragmatics_ for query reformulation in Knowledge Graphs. My thesis is tentatively titled _A methodology for reformulating failing Knowledge Graph queries using schema-data and instance-data awareness_, where contextual reformulations are suggested for failing graph queries. 

Outside of RPI I enjoy reading books ranging from fiction to non-fiction. Edgar Allan Poe, Roald Dahl, Salman Rushdie, Umberto Eco would always find a place in my list of favourite writers. I enjoy graphic novels as well and rate Alan Moore, Mark Millar, Frank Miller very highly *as if they needed my rating*. Anime and manga also find a place in my heart and Hayao Miyazaki, Shinichiro Watanabe and Satoshi Kon are my favourites. In my previous workplace I had time for manga drawing and digital posters using Photoshop, GIMP and Flash but In the last few years I have started to learn Indian Classical music during my free time. I enjoy Western Classical, Indian Classical, Blues, Beatles, Classic Rock, Simon and Garfunkel and a lot of Indian artists. I also play the tin whistle and the harmonica. If you ever wanted to work on language processing and Linked Data or taste Indian cuisine or just _Madras Filter Coffee_, you can shoot me an email
