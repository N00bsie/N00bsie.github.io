Hi! I am Amar, a PhD student at the [Tetherless World Constellation](https://tw.rpi.edu/) under the inimitable [Jim Hendler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hendler). I came to RPI in Fall '11 and since then I have worked on a variety of things like inferring knowledge from text using Knowledge Graphs, Question Answering on Linked Data using Watson, and Summarization of Customer Support Logs.
